# TaggerFlow

A Tag Recommendation System for Stack Overflow Posts

## Why Tagging?
* Tags are a means of connecting experts with questions they will be able to answer by sorting questions into specific, well-defined categories.
* Tags can also be used to help to identify questions that are interesting or relevant to you.
* Clicking on a tag below a question brings you to a page that shows all questions within that tag.
* Each question may only contain 5 tags at a maximum, so it is important to choose ones that best describe the question.
